ClipFarmer is an end-to-end video processing system that converts long videos into short, vertical, attention-optimized clips by:-
->Detecting the loudest segment of the video (most engaging moment)
->Tracking faces frame-by-frame
->Cropping the video to a 9:16 vertical format, keeping the subject centered
->Preserving original audio
->Delivering a ready-to-post clip for platforms like Reels, Shorts, and TikTok
->The system is deployed on AWS EC2, powered by FastAPI, FFmpeg, MediaPipe, and a Next.js frontend.

Running Locally
Backend
Requirements

Python 3.10 recommended

FFmpeg installed

Linux, macOS, or WSL

Install dependencies:

pip install fastapi uvicorn mediapipe==0.10.14 opencv-python numpy
sudo apt install ffmpeg libgl1


Run the server:

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000


API documentation:

Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


Open:

http://localhost:3000

Deployment Notes
Backend (AWS EC2)

Runs as a long-lived service (tmux or systemd)

Designed to handle large video uploads

Performs CPU-intensive processing tasks

Frontend (Vercel)

Used for UI and client interaction

Large file uploads are not routed through Vercel API routes due to size limits

Production setup should use direct backend uploads or object storage (S3 / R2)

Known Constraints

Vercel API routes impose strict payload size limits

MediaPipe is more stable on Python 3.10 than 3.12

Single-worker configuration recommended to avoid FFmpeg race conditions

Future Work

Progress tracking via WebSockets

Multi-clip generation per video

Direct uploads using object storage

Improved multi-face handling

GPU acceleration

Job queue and background workers

Motivation

ClipFarmer is built as a practical system rather than a demo.
It focuses on real-world constraints such as media processing performance, deployment issues, and frontend-backend interaction at scale.
